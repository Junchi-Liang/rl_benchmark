# Asynchronous advantage actor-critic

Original paper: ["Asynchronous Methods for Deep Reinforcement Learning"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01783)

Though original algorithm in the paper is asynchronous, researchers have found asynchronous update is not necessary. So synchronous version is provided here.
